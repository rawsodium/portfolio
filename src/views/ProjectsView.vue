            I want to be able to showcase some of the things that I normally don't get to. It's still very much a work in
            progress, but I'm working on rolling out updates."

            was to create an image-processing application using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and various
            object-oriented design patterns. The application has a GUI built in Swing, and implements support for image
            transformations such as blur, sharpen, filter, flip, load and save. It was created using test-driven development,
            and was tested using the JUnit framework."

            to breed a goose with the best possible combination of traits. I worked on rendering the display of each goose's
            traits, as well as composed some of the background music. This was my first hackathon, and overall a fun learning
            experience!"
